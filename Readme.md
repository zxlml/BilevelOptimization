# Codes for "Stability-based Generalization Assessment for Stochastic Bilevel Optimization" accepted by IJCAI 2024.

# Code & Data Acknowledgement

## Hyperparameter Optimization

As for hyperparameter optimization task, we employed the codes from [1] (https://githubfast.com/baofff/stability_ho) with several modifications (e.g., remove the re-initialization operation).

## Meta Learning

(2) As for meta learning task, we employed the codes from [2] (https://githubfast.com/JunjieYang97/stocBiO) .



# Data Source

# MNIST data set for data cleaning 

MNIST data [3] can be downloaded from the Python library "torch.utils.data"

# Omniglot data set for one-shot learning

Omniglot data [4] can be downloaded from https://githubfast.com/brendenlake/omniglot

**BilevelOptimization** is the official implementation of the IJCAI 2024 paper *"Fine-grained Analysis of Stability and Generalization for Stochastic Bilevel Optimization"*. It provides first-order stochastic bilevel optimization (SBO) solvers together with an empirical validation framework that connects the **on-average argument stability** of an algorithm with its **generalization gap**, reproducing all key findings of the paper on hyperparameter optimization as data reweighting.

* 🧮 **Three Algorithms from the Paper**
  <br> SSGD (Algorithm 1), TSGD with warm start (Algorithm 2), and UD with re-initialization (Algorithm 3), all following the paper's convention (K = outer iterations, T = inner iterations).

* 📈 **Generalization Gap Assessment**
  <br> Full-dataset validation / testing errors and their divergence (Eq. 2), tracked over training for different sample sizes, iteration budgets, and learning rates.

* 🔬 **Empirical Stability Measurement**
  <br> On-average argument stability (Definition 5) measured by re-running the algorithm with one validation sample replaced, validating the O(K/m1) theory (Table 1).

* ⚙️ **Paper-faithful Experiment Pipeline**
  <br> 50% label-corrupted MNIST reweighting, 784/256/10 MLP, batch size 8, step sizes 0.01 (inner) / 5 (outer), multi-seed averaging with CSV + curve outputs.

## 🧮 Algorithms

The paper considers the stochastic bilevel formulation

```
min_{x}  R(x) = F(x, y*(x)) = E_{ξ}[f(x, y*(x); ξ)]
s.t.     y*(x) = argmin_{y} G(x, y) = E_{ζ}[g(x, y; ζ)]
```

and analyzes first-order gradient methods. Three solvers are provided (`core/ablo.py`):

| Algorithm | Paper | Key Property | Setting |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **SSGD** | Algorithm 1 | Single timescale, one inner + one outer step per iteration (`T = 1`) | `ho_algo='ssgd'` / `T=1` |
| **TSGD** | Algorithm 2 | Two timescale: `T` inner steps per outer step, **warm start** `y0_{k+1} = y^T_k` | `ho_algo='tsgd'` |
| **UD** | Algorithm 3 (Bao et al., 2021) | Two timescale with **re-initialization** `y0_k = y0` before each outer loop | `ho_algo='ud'` |

The generalization gap (Eq. 2) is estimated by the divergence between the validation error and the testing error, and the empirical `l2` on-average argument stability (Definition 5) is measured via paired runs in which one validation sample is replaced by an independent draw from `D1`.

<span id='installation'/>

## 🔧 Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/zxlml/BilevelOptimization.git
cd BilevelOptimization

# Create virtual environment
conda create -n sbo python=3.10 -y
conda activate sbo

# Install dependencies
pip install torch torchvision matplotlib pytest
```

The MNIST dataset is downloaded automatically by `torchvision` on the first run (cached under `workspace/datasets/mnist`).

<span id='quickstart'/>

## ⚡ Quick Start

All experiments are driven by `Hyperparameter_Optimization.py` (paper settings by default):

```bash
# 1. Fast end-to-end sanity check (a few seconds)
python Hyperparameter_Optimization.py --mode smoke

# 2. Fig.1 analog: vary inner iterations T (1, 32) with K = 5000, 3 seeds
python Hyperparameter_Optimization.py --mode fig1 --K_max 5000 --seeds 42 52 82

# 3. Fig.2 analog: SSGD (T = 1) with varying validation size m1 (500, 2000), 5 seeds
python Hyperparameter_Optimization.py --mode fig2 --K_max 5000 --seeds 42 52 62 72 82

# 4. Learning-rate sensitivity: lr_l x lr_h grid on SSGD
python Hyperparameter_Optimization.py --mode lr --K_max 3000 --seeds 42 52 62

# 5. Empirical on-average argument stability (Definition 5)
python Hyperparameter_Optimization.py --mode stability --K_max 2000 --seeds 42

# Single run with a custom configuration (also supports --mode all)
python core/run.py  # see Hyperparameter_Optimization.default_config() for the full arg list
```

Every mode writes averaged curves (`*_summary.csv`) and per-curve plots into `workspace/exp/<mode>_<timestamp>/`. Curves are evaluated every `--eval_every` outer iterations on the full validation / test sets.

## 📊 Experimental Results

Reproduction curves (averaged over seeds, matching paper Sec. 5 settings) are provided in [`results/`](./results/). Raw summary CSVs: [`results/fig1_summary.csv`](./results/fig1_summary.csv), [`fig2_summary.csv`](./results/fig2_summary.csv), [`lr_summary.csv`](./results/lr_summary.csv), [`stability.csv`](./results/stability.csv).

**Fig.1 analog — vary `T` and `K` (TSGD, 3 seeds, `K_max = 5000`)**

| Config | val @K=1000 | val @K=5000 | test @K=5000 | gap @K=5000 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| TSGD, T=1  | 1.559 | **1.138** | 1.144 | +0.006 |
| TSGD, T=32 | **1.188** (min) | 2.037 (overfits) | 2.167 | **+0.130** |

→ Too large `K` and `T` reduce generalization due to overfitting; with `T = 32` the testing error increases after `K ≈ 1000` (paper: overfitting for large `K` with `T = 32`).

**Fig.2 analog — SSGD (`T = 1`) with varying validation size `m1` (5 seeds, `K_max = 5000`)**

| Config | val error | test error | gap | 0-1 test error |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| m1 = 500  | 1.067 | 1.118 | **+0.051** (grows with K) | 0.222 |
| m1 = 2000 | 1.114 | **1.099** | **-0.015** (stable) | 0.200 |

→ A larger validation set improves generalization: the gap of the small-`m1` run grows steadily with `K`, while the large-`m1` gap stays flat (paper Fig. 2).

**Learning-rate sensitivity (SSGD, `K = 3000`, 3 seeds)**

| lr_l (inner) | 0-1 test error (lr_h = 0.5) | 0-1 test error (lr_h = 5.0) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 0.001 (underfit) | 0.374 | 0.376 |
| 0.01 (paper)     | **0.181** | **0.182** |
| 0.1 (too large)  | 0.338 | 0.317 |

→ Appropriate learning rates are crucial; the paper's setting `lr_l = 0.01, lr_h = 5` lies in the stable optimum.

**Empirical `l2` on-average argument stability (SSGD, 3 replaced validation samples)**

| m1 \ K | K = 1000 | K = 2000 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 500  | 2.25e-4 | 6.26e-4 (x2.8) |
| 2000 | 1.17e-4 | 2.10e-4 (x1.8) |

→ The drift grows roughly linearly with `K` and shrinks with `m1`, consistent with the `O(K/m1)` bounds of Table 1.
